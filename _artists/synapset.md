  <p><strong>Synapset</strong> is a blitz collective formed in Barcelona, over a
  week in the beginning of April 2010. It is based on experimenting with the
  risk of taking opportunities in life and reproduce them with machines. The
  project explores the space existing between people and how music interconnects
  them.</p>
