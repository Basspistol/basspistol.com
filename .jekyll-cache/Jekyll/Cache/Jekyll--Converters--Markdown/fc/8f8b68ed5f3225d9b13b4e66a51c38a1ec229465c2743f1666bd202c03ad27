<p>While the A-side offers a sweet balade about taking social initiatives away from the the web, its b-side opens up for a new, dark voice. The story of a network misfit, finding it hard to cut through the noise of cats, selfies and political propaganda. But what if there was another space within that space? What if there was a place the strange could call a home? Well there is one, itâ€™s nicknamed â€œDarkwebâ€ and you might like it.</p>
