I"<p>An extremly lively piece of music for being an abiotism. This deep-house comes with a touch of variation that can only be found in the scandinavian forests. Reminicent of legendary tracks from John Tejadaâ€™s album <i>â€œCleaning Sounds Is a Filthy Businessâ€,</i> it caries all the movements you need to express yourself on the dancefloor, withing a repeat-1 friendly format of 4 minutes.</p>
