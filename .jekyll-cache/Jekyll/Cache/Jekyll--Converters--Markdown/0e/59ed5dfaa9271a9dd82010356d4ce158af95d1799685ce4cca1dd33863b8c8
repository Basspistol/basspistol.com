        no time to loose<br />
        the people of the world is having the blues<br />

lyrics: |-
  &lt;em&gt;get down&lt;br /&gt;
  it's now or never&lt;br /&gt;
  are you like me do you feel the fever?&lt;br /&gt;
  do you also dream of the words all together?&lt;br /&gt;
  of colors , love and of happy for ever?&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  it can't be that hard we just have to work&lt;br /&gt;
  the politicians are all an obvious set of jerks&lt;br /&gt;
  lets challange the nonsense just for a while&lt;br /&gt;
  and later you'll tell me it was worth to try&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  step up&lt;br /&gt;
  take your time&lt;br /&gt;
  but don't be too long you don't want to waste mine&lt;br /&gt;
  and if you don't want to, to me its fine&lt;br /&gt;
  but the present situation wont be that kind&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  they say to let you live they should produce your car&lt;br /&gt;
  but if you ask me i think they go too far&lt;br /&gt;
  if you need ten they'll make 4000 jars&lt;br /&gt;
  and this is the message of the following bars&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  BRIDGE&lt;br /&gt;
  it's all about the money&lt;br /&gt;
  it's all about the flooz&lt;br /&gt;
  it's not about love&lt;br /&gt;
  and it's not about yous&lt;br /&gt;
  it'as all about mass production&lt;br /&gt;
  hyper corruption where your the one to lose&lt;br /&gt;
  so get down stand up&lt;br /&gt;
  lets fight them back&lt;br /&gt;
  we could blow them to hell in a heavy attack&lt;br /&gt;
  push them real hard out of their track&lt;br /&gt;
  brothers and sisters it's of you we lack&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  stand up&lt;br /&gt;
  no time to loose&lt;br /&gt;
  the people of the world is having the blues&lt;br /&gt;
  they tired of being ruled by the everlasting fools&lt;br /&gt;
  it's time we get together on our own set of rules&lt;br /&gt;

  they say we have to bow to get allong with our lifes&lt;br /&gt;
  but that my brother is the fatest of lies&lt;br /&gt;
  they give us some shit and you play the fly&lt;br /&gt;
  do realy like that game of selling and buy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
