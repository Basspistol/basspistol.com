I"ä<p>Los Ganglios is a Spanish PORC band (a conglomerate Punk Techno Rock and Cumbia) with a really strong and peculiar vibe. To some extend many of their tracks will feel plain weird to the non-Spanish speaking audience. But the videos they put out should appeal to anyone with a bit of humor and a taste for anti-aestethics and retro-computing.</p>

<p>The way they merge the ordinary with the extraordinary is quite mesmerising. If you are lucky to find yourself in a city where <a href="http://losganglios.com/agenda/" title="Los Ganglios dates">they are touring,</a> you need to go: Live they burn down the roof using a simple and effective set-up of hardware electronics combined with guitars and a chanting choir of die-hard fans.</p>
