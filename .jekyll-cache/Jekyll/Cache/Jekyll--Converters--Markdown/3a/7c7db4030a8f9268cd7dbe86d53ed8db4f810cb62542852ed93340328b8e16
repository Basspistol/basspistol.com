I"?<p>Every now in then, our dimension aligns with a thousand year old intergalactic tradition called #AcidDecember. When this happens, musicians worldwide are compulsively submitting tracks to a mysterious email address. These pieces of delicious music are then being published one by one on http://acid.datapop.se during December and beyond.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re late on the news; it started the 1st of December and there are already 5 delicious tracks published. However, it would seem it is possible to contribute during the entire month. Are you going to send something in?</p>
