I"Ó<p>PinGNU is a cybersoul banger of rank; a weird and wonderful mix between autotuned Râ€™nâ€™B, boombass and dope geekery. Blurring the lines of cooldom and cuteness, this track is a triptych love song addressed to all the FLOSS coder out there, in the Name of the GNU, The Pingu, and the Holy User.</p>

<p>Lyrics:</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a little Pingu, riding on a GNU.Looking at the world, looking at you.Free at the core, i wonder why donâ€™t you,Look at me the way i look at you.</p>

<p>It would be so nice,if you could take me in.Your computer and i could change the world weâ€™re in.Your freedom is being diluted.And your code is being polluted.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a big GNU with my little Pingu,Looking at the world, looking at you.Free at the core, i wonder why donâ€™t you,Look at me the way i look at you.</p>

<p>It would be so nice,if you could compute.Your freedom is not to dilute,Someone has taken your tool into dispute,This is what together we should refute.</p>
