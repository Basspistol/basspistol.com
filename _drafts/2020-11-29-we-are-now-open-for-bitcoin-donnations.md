Without the good services of [Alsenet.com](http://www.alsenet.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} there would be no Basspistol. Not in it's current shape anyways. And today we're proud to announce that they have blessed the Outernational Music Syndicate with the infrastructure to receive donations in Bitcoins.

> **Bitcoin**(**₿**) is a [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-whoissn-20) and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). It is a decentralized [digital currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency) without a [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the [peer-to-peer bitcoin network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network) without the need for intermediaries.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-JSC-12) Transactions are verified by network [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_&#40;networking&#41;) through [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and recorded in a public [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) called a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Blockchain). Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-22)&nbsp;– [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)

While it doesn't change our position as a non-profit foundation, enabling our community to support us financially in ways that align with our vision of self-governance, data-sovereignty and autonomy is a move we have long been waiting to make. Longing for it. Simply because non of the existing systems have met our ethical requirements. Whilie there plenty of tools for Artists and performers to ask for support, they all leverage traditional banks and stake-holders that we consider on a path of obsolescence in the 21st century. Basspistol strives for societal change and decentralization. Nothing express these goals better than the concept of Cryptocurrencies.

For now, tossing your Satoshies at us will not give you anything else than cosmic tokens of eternal gratitude from the Outernational Music Syndicate. (Basically just good old fashion karma, if you like.) However, we are exploring ways of rewarding supporters and to effectively and automatically distribute the donations equally among the Artists members of the musical syndicate.
