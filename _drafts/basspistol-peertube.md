This project has always been about independence and auto-sufficiency. And it may seem like a strange quest in a world where publication is free of charge. But is it freedom? The platform we have come to rely on have repeatedly shown us that they aren't at our disposal. We are at theirs. They dictate what we can share and to whom, effectively creating a form of racketeering. Everyone who runs a fascbook page has seen the indecent messages: *"Boost this post for 34 Croolars to reach 3.5 robot accounts", "Sponsor this video to get more like from disengaged people."* Does it work? Hardly. Is it worth it? Hell know\! Who wants to be a mere data-tax collector for global corporations?
