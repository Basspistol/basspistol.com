DEF CON is one of the world's largest annual hacker conventions, held every year in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since 2013, SomaFM has provided the music for the DEF CON Chill room. That theme continues with SomaFM broadcasting this special year-round stream from San Francisco, hosted by the DJs who entertain the DEF CON 26 chill room this year in Vegas. 


DEF CON DJ Bios

kampf, DEF CON Resident

With over a decade of experience as a college radio DJ at KWCR on Nerd Show, kampf has waded long and deep through the muddied waters of electronic music, casting his rod time and again to obtain, then share the eclectic, the compelling, the sounds off the beaten path and those lesser know varieties or species. Also featured on Groovement.co.uk and UtahFM.org.
Resident Chill Out Room and Lounge DJ for DEF CON 19 thru 22, Pool Party and Wall of Sheep. A veteran volunteer for the conference who is pleased to be working with SomaFM and providing music for the con once more.
You can find kampf on Twitter, Mixcloud, Facebook and Vine.

DJ Merin MC, Resident DJ

Merin has been involved in SomaFM from its inception. Her contributions include designing station logos, producing live events, partner marketing, photography, writing and editing site content, and helping curate the stations. She has DJ'd for SomaFM at Chillits, the How Weird Street Fair, and DEF CON.

DJ Pie, Resident DJ

Although my more recent gigs spinning metal and hiphop for the Bay Area Derby Girls would seem to indicate otherwise, I'm an oldschool bedroom and chillout party DJ with a soft spot for the clickier, crunchier side of downtempo. Having heard a lot about DEF CON from my coworkers during many years in the software industry, I'm especially pleased at this opportunity to attend and help provide a chill atmosphere.

DJ Jon Logan, Resident DJ

Jon has been active in the chillout scene in San Francisco for over 15 years. As one of the co-founders of the legendary "Woom" deep chill parties, he also spend several years in China performing in clubs there.

Rusty Hodge, Program & Music Director

I program music for several SomaFM channels, and I've been following DEF CON from afar since the very first one. So I'll be spinning a mix of downtempo/ambient/triphop/idm and late at night I'll get more into space music and deep ambient.
