But we don't sell any because we respect the straight line between the Fans and the Artists we promote. If you are interested in buying music, you should opt for a DIRECT ORDER at the source: by talking to the <a href="/artists/">artists or go to their respective stores.</a> <br />

The same applies regarding information about the Syndiacte members: check their websites. If you can't find any website, it probably means they don't want to be found.<br />
