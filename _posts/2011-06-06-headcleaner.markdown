description: 'Headcleaner by Dr. Tikov. A minimalistic opus of dubish Russian techno, made in Barcelona.'
---
Inspired by the Spanish city's hectic nightlife, its legendary night-clubs and house venues such as The Moog, our infamously talented Doctor produced his own approach to the rich jungle of Catalan minimal tehcno. Homeopathic and vital, this LP is a journey into the self, a trip into your own body and a healthy neurotic cleansing.
