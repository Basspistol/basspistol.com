I'm waiting for better times
I'm laying home in the sofa and waiting for better times.
Why should i wait here? I can do something better with my life!
I don't want' to lay here.
I don't want to lay here anymore,
I go downtown and meet the buddies.
We go to Årsta.
Have a fallafel at Paniras Kebab
Sitting in the square chillling.
Then we pull some tags on the bench over there.
Me and my buddies can do miracles.
Together we can creatie something new
You and me, common be good! 
You and me.
You and me, we could do something!
Should we do something?
Yes!
Should we wait for better times?
