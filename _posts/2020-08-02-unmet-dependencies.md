title: Unmet Dependencies
description: >-
  Proprietary tools, consultancies, remote labor... The reality in the digital
  industry is as hard to cope with as it is building software in Haskell.
  Freedom is luxury, but also a burden.

## Oldies, but goldies

It is through these 2 tracks that å¾’ setto ã‚»ãƒƒãƒˆ came to be. Cybersoul bangers of rank; weird and wonderful mixes between autotuned Râ€™nâ€™B, boombass and dope geekery. Blurring the lines of cooldom and cuteness.
