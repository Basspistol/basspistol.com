A smol EP for human kind. A giant leap for me. This is 徒settoセット's first release that is entirely produced using Cooperative software (AKA FLOSS). As in: no hardware\!\! Yes\! it is also that dog's first release in over a decade where all the synths and drum machines are software modules. It features flute and sax from the talented [Randulo](https://indieweb.social/@randulo){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and we are happy to share it with you.

Let me know what you think\! You can talk to me [here](/chat/#read)
