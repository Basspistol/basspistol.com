## Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?

### The Paperplattune!

Since the future of free publications implicating links to data in a semi-regulated data-market is kinda uncertain, i was looking at alternatives for the webzurfs. During my quest, lured by a very cool-looking marketing bot, i chackked the platoon out.

And you should too! Damn, The geeky level of this i feeeel!Â  BUT NOT TOO MUCH! persona with g33k-values, in POWER! Crypto AF. Stupid smart level 7000.

Dirty, yet slick production outlet! The quirks of their web-path is dark and probably scary for the non-techie. Funky links and sexy shells all the way. Dadang you should follow that whole rabbit hole!
